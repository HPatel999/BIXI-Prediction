Implementors :Rohaan, Yajiv Sai Luckheenarain, Harsh Patel <br/>
Context:School Assignment/Project <br/>:bicyclist:
We were Provided code that predicted car accidents in Montreal by Dawson teachers, which we used as a base to implement the follwwing. <br/>
The Bixi Challenge is a computer science project that asked us to use the data that Bixi (Montreal’s public bicycle lending system) from the year 2014-2018 to try and predict what the bicycle usage would be like in 2019. Obviously, we are in 2020 so we already have the actual datas from 2019, but the project’s goal is to try to compare whether our predictive model predicted with a certain margin of accuracy what happened that year.:biking_woman: <br/>
